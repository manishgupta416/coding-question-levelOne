    <!-- Here is an API: https://otpgenerator.ishanjirety.repl.co/get-otp?name= . You will enter a name as input from your app and send this API a request with the name along with it
(this will be the final URL : https://otpgenerator.ishanjirety.repl.co/get-otp?name=Nameentered) on button click . In the response you will get an OTP which should be shown on
the screen.
Followup1: Make another input section that asks the user to guess the OTP and for checking whether the guess is equal to the actual one or not add a button "Validate" which
on clicking shows the message "Success " or "Failure" depending . Response is coming in the form of Name-OTP format so something like Pratyush-570928.So compare the
OTP value from the response as well as the input which is being entered -->
