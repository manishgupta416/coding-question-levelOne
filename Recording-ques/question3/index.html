    <!-- So what Akshay wanted Divya to do was to have a button in the display which on every click show a random word from a list of words 
(Divya did it using Vanilla JS on Vscode)
Hint: use the inbuilt function random from Math library for solving it -->
<button id="btn">Random words</button>
<div id="show-msg"></div>
